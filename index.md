## Humans Shouldn't Have To Think About This

Butter is an experimental project to simply and transparently handle the things
a human shouldn't have to think about when deploying a production application.

The goal of the project is that anyone can easily deploy things that are stable,
secure, and maintainble, while fully understanding how they work.
