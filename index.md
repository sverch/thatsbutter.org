## Humans Shouldn't Have To Think About This

Butter is an infrastructure tool that simply and transparently handles the
things a human shouldn't have to think about when deploying a production
application.

The goal of the project is that anyone can easily deploy things that are stable,
secure, and maintainble, while fully understanding how they work.  See below for
an example of what it looks like now.
